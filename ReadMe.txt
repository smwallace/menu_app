MenuApp
by Sheila Wallace

This sample menu app displays categories of food items. Tapping on the category 
will display a list of food items in the category, and tapping on the item in the 
food item list will display detailed information about the item. You can tap a 
button on the detailed information screen to display allergen, nutrition, and 
ingredient information.

On the Categories screen, you can swipe down to refresh the data for the app.
Currently there are three different valid data sets available, and one error data set,
which results in an error alert being displayed and the last data set remaining
in the lists.

Unit tests are in the MenuAppTests folder and UI test are in the MenuAppUITests folder.

Note that no provisioning profiles are provided in the Xcode project.
